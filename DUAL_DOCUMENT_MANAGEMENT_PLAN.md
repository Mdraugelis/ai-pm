## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **SQLite for Development**: Using SQLite for simplicity. Can migrate to PostgreSQL for production.
2. **LLM Classification**: Using Claude for automatic classification ensures high accuracy without manual tagging.
3. **Dual API Endpoints**: Separate endpoints for input documents vs blueprints maintains clear separation of concerns.
4. **Token Budget Strategy**: Static allocation for blueprints ensures they're always available to the agent.

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Add semantic search for blueprints (future enhancement)
- [ ] Implement blueprint versioning (future enhancement)
- [ ] Add collaborative blueprint editing (future enhancement)
- [ ] Implement blueprint templates (future enhancement)

### Dependencies Added
- `pypdf` - PDF parsing
- `python-docx` - DOCX parsing
- `striprtf` - RTF parsing (optional)
- `PyYAML` - YAML parsing (optional)
